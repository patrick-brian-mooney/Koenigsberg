"""Quick test for how Cython handles bytearrays. This was intended to pare down
a problem with Cython's handling of the data type that turned out to be a bug
that was fixed by upgrading Cython to 0.29.32; see
https://www.reddit.com/r/Cython/comments/wep60b/trouble_with_bytearrays_during_cython_conversion/
