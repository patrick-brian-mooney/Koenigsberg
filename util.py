    to supply decorators but that cannot be imported. It responds to a request for
    any (unknown) attribute by returning a stub decorator that simply returns the

    This is useful, for instance, for marking up code that can be run with Cython
    with decorators that provide useful information to the Cython compiler, but that
    will still run under pure Python without Cython installed: an instance of this
    class can be used in place of the Cython module if importing Cython raises an
    ImportError.

    Might fail if the attribute of the module that's trying to be located happens to
    be an attribute that this class inherits from OBJECT; these are all dunder names
    and most or all would be unusual to try to locate in a module. Still, if this
    starts happening, __getattr__ might need to be replaced with __getattribute__.
